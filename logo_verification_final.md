# Logo Verification - Final Check

## Professional Background Logos:
1. ❌ Franzetti Arbitration - No logo (intentionally null)
2. ❌ King & Spalding LLP - Logo NOT visible (need to scroll up to verify)
3. ✅ Dechert LLP - "Dechert" logo visible
4. ✅ Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP - Logo visible
5. ✅ Crowell & Moring LLP - "Crowell" logo visible
6. ✅ Wald & Advogados Associados - "WALD" logo visible
7. ✅ Dinamarco & Rossi Advocacia - Logo visible

## Academia Logos:
1. ✅ University of Miami - Logo visible (appears blurry/faded in screenshot)
2. ✅ Georgetown University Law Center - Logo visible

## Education Logos:
1. ✅ Georgetown University Law Center - Logo visible
2. Need to verify FGV and USP logos

## Issues to Fix:
- King & Spalding logo may not be showing - need to verify path
- Franzetti Arbitration has no logo set (logo: null) - this is intentional per the client's list showing it as "Already uploaded"
