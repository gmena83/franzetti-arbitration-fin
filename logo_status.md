# Logo Status Verification

Based on the screenshots, I can see the following logos are displaying correctly:

## Professional Background:
1. ❌ Franzetti Arbitration - No logo visible (set to null in code)
2. ❌ King & Spalding LLP - Logo NOT visible (not scrolled into view yet, but entry is there)
3. ✅ Dechert LLP - "Dechert" logo visible
4. ✅ Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP - Logo visible
5. ✅ Crowell & Moring LLP - "Crowell" logo visible
6. ✅ Wald & Advogados Associados - "WALD" logo visible
7. ✅ Dinamarco & Rossi Advocacia - Logo visible

## Academia:
1. ✅ University of Miami - Logo visible
2. ✅ Georgetown University Law Center - Logo visible

## Education:
1. ✅ Georgetown University Law Center - Logo visible
2. Need to verify FGV and USP logos by scrolling

## Issues to Fix:
1. Franzetti Arbitration needs the uploaded logo added
2. King & Spalding logo path needs to be verified - currently set to "/images/logos/king-spalding.jpg"

The client mentioned "Already uploaded" for Franzetti Arbitration logo, so I need to add it.
