# Logo Debug Notes

## Files verified to exist:
1. /home/ubuntu/franzetti-arbitration/client/public/images/Franzetti-principal-dark.svg (12655 bytes)
2. /home/ubuntu/franzetti-arbitration/client/public/images/logos/king-spalding.jpg (1079367 bytes)

## Code paths in Home.tsx:
- Franzetti Arbitration: logo: "/images/Franzetti-principal-dark.svg"
- King & Spalding: logo: "/images/logos/king-spalding.jpg"

## Issue:
The logos ARE in the code and files exist, but the first two entries (Franzetti and King & Spalding) are not visible in the screenshot because they are scrolled above the viewport.

The screenshot shows entries starting from Dechert LLP (index 8), meaning Franzetti and King & Spalding are above the visible area.

## Verification needed:
Scroll up slightly to see the first two entries with their logos.
