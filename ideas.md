# Franzetti Arbitration Website - Design Ideas

Since this is a replication of an existing website with specific client changes, the design approach must match the original Replit site exactly. However, I'll document the design philosophy being used.

## Selected Design Approach: Professional Legal Minimalism

**Design Movement**: Modern Professional Legal/Corporate with clean, sophisticated aesthetics

**Core Principles**:
1. **Authoritative Elegance** - Convey expertise and trustworthiness through refined typography and restrained color palette
2. **Content-First Hierarchy** - Let the professional credentials and experience speak through clear, readable layouts
3. **Subtle Sophistication** - Use understated design elements that suggest quality without ostentation
4. **Warm Professionalism** - Balance corporate authority with approachable warmth through color accents

**Color Philosophy**:
- **Primary**: Deep charcoal/slate (#1a1a2e or similar) for authority and sophistication
- **Accent**: Aquamarine/Teal (#5BBFBA) for bullet points and interactive elements - suggests trust and clarity
- **Secondary Accent**: Nude/Beige (#D4A574) for warmth and approachability
- **Background**: Clean white (#FFFFFF) with subtle off-white sections for depth
- **Text**: Dark slate for body, lighter grays for secondary information

**Layout Paradigm**:
- Full-width hero sections with professional photography
- Two-column layouts for content sections (image + text)
- Clean navigation with dropdown menus
- Generous whitespace to convey premium quality
- Footer with dark background for visual grounding

**Signature Elements**:
1. Professional headshot photography prominently featured
2. Testimonial quotes with distinctive styling (quotation marks, italic text)
3. Aquamarine bullet points as visual anchors throughout lists

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- Smooth hover transitions on navigation items
- Subtle fade-in animations on scroll
- Clean dropdown menus for nested navigation
- Language switcher for international audience

**Animation**:
- Gentle fade-in on page load
- Smooth hover states on buttons and links
- Subtle scale on image hovers
- Dropdown menus with smooth reveal

**Typography System**:
- **Headings**: Serif or elegant sans-serif for authority (Playfair Display or similar)
- **Body**: Clean sans-serif for readability (Inter, Open Sans)
- **Accent**: Italics for testimonials and quotes
- **Hierarchy**: Clear size progression from H1 to body text
